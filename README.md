# We are a non-profit Civic Tech research lab dedicated to combating digital threats against truth, democracy, and social unity. Across the Global South, democratic processes are a toxic mix between deliberate disinformation, unintentional misinformation, social divisions, and rising polarization. With technological advancements, confronting these digital threats, such as deep fakes and cheap fakes, is becoming more challenging.
